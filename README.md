## Install

The wait is over now you can enjoy dracula with the power of rust [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)

In order for lsd to display glyphs correctly you must have a nerd font installed. https://www.nerdfonts.com/

Config file location

Non-Windows

On non-Windows systems lsd follows the XDG Base Directory Specification convention for the location of the configuration file. The configuration dir lsd uses is itself named lsd. In that directory it looks first for a file called config.yaml. For most people it should be enough to put their config file at ~/.config/lsd/config.yaml.

Windows

On Windows systems lsd only looks for the config.yaml files in one location: %APPDATA%\lsd\

In the config.yaml change the line to

theme: dracula
  
If there is no config file please feel free to use this one

Theme folder

Create a theme folder in lsd  ~/.config/lsd/themes/.yaml
